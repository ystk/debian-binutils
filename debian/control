Description: GNU assembler, linker and binary utilities
 The programs in this package are used to assemble, link and manipulate
 binary and object files.  They may be used in conjunction with a compiler
 and various libraries to build programs.

Conflicts: libbfd-dev
Provides: libbfd-dev
Replaces: libbfd-dev, libc5-dev
Description: GNU binary utilities (BFD development files)
 This package includes header files and static libraries necessary to build
 programs which use the GNU BFD library, which is part of binutils.  Note
 that building Debian packages which depend on the shared libbfd is Not
 Allowed.

Package: binutils-multiarch
Architecture: any
Priority: extra
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, binutils (= ${binary:Version})
Description: Binary utilities that support multi-arch targets
 The programs in this package are used to manipulate binary and object
 files that may have been created on other architectures.  This package
 is primarily for multi-architecture developers and cross-compilers and
 is not needed by normal users or developers.  Note that a cross-assembling
 version of gas is not included in this package, just the binary utilities.
 .
 NORMAL USERS SHOULD NOT INSTALL THIS PACKAGE.  It's meant only for those
 requiring support for reading info from binaries from other architectures.
