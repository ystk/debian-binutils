Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, binutils (= ${binary:Version})
Provides: multiarch-binutils
Description: Binary utilities that support multi-arch targets
 The programs in this package are used to manipulate binary and object
 files that may have been created on other architectures.  This package
 is primarily for multi-architecture developers and cross-compilers and
 is not needed by normal users or developers.  Note that a cross-assembling
 version of gas is not included in this package, just the binary utilities.
 NORMAL USERS SHOULD NOT INSTALL THIS PACKAGE.  It's meant only for those
 requiring support for reading info from binaries from other architectures.
